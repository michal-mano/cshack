A Flutter application drafted during the 2023 Technion Computer Science Hackathon (Semi-finalist).

##The Challenge
A hospital is a hard place for a chronically ill child to be - especially those that have to return for ongoing treatment, or stay there overnight. Between the stress and the boredom, it's easy to get discouraged and feel a lack of motivation to continue treatment.

##Our Solution
Stronger is a mobile application that gameifies healthcare to make the experience more appealing for a young patient. A connection is made between the adult's and the child's phones. From there, the adult can add tasks related to the treatment the child needs to receive - blood work, checkups, dialysis, whatever is relevant to the specific patient. When the child opens the app they can "start" the task and keep track of how much time has passed - the more time (spent waiting on doctors, in traffic, etc) the more points they receive.
With points earned, the child can either buy powerups for in-app games or buy items from the parent store (which the parent can choose to set up).

##What's next?
- Several aspects of the app are demo versions due to the short time in which it was developed. In particular, the store is hard-coded and doesn't have the functionality we set out to give it. Were we to continue developing this app, we would focus on enabling the addition of items to the store and connecting it to the point system.
- Another aspect that could be improved is security. The data was stored in a simple database (hosted on Firebase)
